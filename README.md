 ### ðŸ‘‹ Hi, I'm Walt Bowers
 
Iâ€™m a proven problem solver and technology evangelist. I am the conduit between business decision makers and engineers. Not only can I engineer solutions to complex problems, I communicate and present the issues and solutions equally well to all stakeholders including C-level management, customers, and geeks. I possess the ability to quickly understand emerging technologies and how to apply the appropriate technology to a given solution.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on Internet of Things
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ML, NLP, and PyTorch.
